This code was written using [jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/6.3/) version 6.3.0, and:
- [jsPsych-psychophysics](https://jspsychophysics.hes.kyushu-u.ac.jp/) 2.3.1 by [Daiichiro Kuroki](https://github.com/kurokida/);
- [This repo](https://github.com/svanhedger/jspsych/tree/master/scripts/backward-digit-span/) by [Stephen Van Hedger](https://svanhedger.github.io/) for the adaptive staircase code.

This code is ready to be run locally (by double-clicking on [index.html](index.html)), but it can be adapted to run experiments on platforms such as [Pavlovia](https://pavlovia.org/), as well as to interface with participant recruiting platforms such as [Prolific](https://www.prolific.co/). **NOTE:** the code cannot save data files locally, it was originally designed to interface with Pavlovia. Blocks of code for running the experiment on Pavlovia are still present, but commented out.

Experimental stimuli can be downloaded [here](https://osf.io/wnefh/).

Tested using Google Chrome on Mac.
